## Getting Started
### Overview
<p>Open Grid is a geographical information systems developed for residents to access public city data in a more intuitive manner. The application supports situational awareness, incident responses and monitoring, historical data retrieval, and real-time advanced analytics.</p>

<p>OpenGrid design has a three-layer service architecture: Presentation, Business and Data. The presentation layer provides the application’s user interface which is a static HTML/JavaScript based GUI that presents a more intuitive and modernized approach that support usage and accessibility on any mobile device and terminals in public safety vehicles.</p>

<p>Business layer which is the service layer implements the business aspects and functionality of the application. Such as defining business rules, design, deployment, maintenance and management of the application which is adaptable based off client specification. </p>

<p> The data layer is where information is stored from databases. OpenGrid utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL open source document database optimized to handle spatial data. Mongo provides high performance, high availability and automatic scaling. The application interacts with different database engines or APIs which makes it easy for other cities: governments, non-profits and/or corporations to adopt the application.</p>

<p>OpenGrid offers configurable methods where administrators can define user roles, system authenticators or remove security features, where verification is no longer a requirement for application accessibility. Administrators can apply certain functions and data-set/s to a specific security group/s and/or users, if relevant.
</p>

    </tr>
    </table>

<br>
<p>
The data results for the above search types and any other search form will appear as point/s, custom icons or markers on the map. Any search type information, whether its performed as a Quick Search or Advanced Search will display on the map and table grid. The table grid displays data as rows.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, there will only be one row of data on the grid (for example, Weather or Bus ID search). Quick search results can be cleared/reset by clicking on the Clear Data button. This action will also stop all data auto-refresh activities, if any are happening in the background.
</p>

<p>
Tweet dataset provides real-time data and automatically refreshes with new data every 30 seconds within set intervals. The data points have active links embedded, when selected the link will open in a new browser window displaying social media content, such as articles, photos and location associated with the tweet.

</table>

<br>

<p>
The Find Data Panel is also called the advanced search, it is used to narrow searches by applying a series of different filters and actions. The user has the ability to enter a combination of search criteria by applying one or more datasets, adding rule/s or group/s for building a search. The panel has map extent setup as default when performing a search; when a search is executed all data will plot within the area of the current map location boundary.
</p>

<p>
All datasets have a default color in case multiple datasets are applied on the map, it helps differentiate between the data. The user also has the ability to modify color, size and opacity of each data point pertaining to a dataset.
</p>

<p>
Using food establishments as an example, a user can search for restaurants and food trucks in Chicago, the two criteria is listed under a single dataset, called Business Licenses. A user may want to run multiple Business Licenses criteria in a single search for comparison purposes. What should a user do since there is a one color limitation and default color per dataset setup?
</p>

<p>
Simple, just add Business Licenses dataset twice, then set one with a filter  <b>License_description = “Retail Food Establishment”</b> and the other <b>License_description = “Mobile Food License”</b>, and assign each dataset a different color by selecting the “Color Option” tool beneath each dataset setup.
</p>

<p>
In the example below, it shows how the search was applied and how each data type is represented on the grid... Retail Food Establishments has the default color of Blue and Mobile Food Licenses is Red.

</div>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 10. Business Licenses Dataset Example</b></p>

<br>

<p>
To further filter a search, a geo-spatial filter can be applied by drawing a shape on a targeted area on a map or selecting one of the pre-defined boundaries from the Select Location section of the panel. Select Location has two geo-spatial options called <b>WITHIN</b> and <b>NEAR</b> (see images below).
</p>

<p>
Amongst applying boundaries to a search, auto refresh component can be setup for a search by the number of intervals in seconds (minimum of 30 seconds, maximum of 3600 seconds or 60 minutes).
</p>

<p>
When a query is submitted, the application will display a message when the query times out. It will also display a message when the search service returns no data.
</p>

<br>

### Existing Queries
#### Commonly Used Queries
<p>
Are popular searches that city residents are most likely to explore within the application. The drop menu has a list of predefined queries that a user can apply as a search. 
</p>

<p>
Each query when selected displays its search parameters under the Select Data section. To run commonly used queries, select a search from the drop list and select Get Data.

<br>

## Data Formation
### Map Grid
<p>
The map grid is interactive, a user can navigate the map using a mouse, keyboard and for mobile devices by swiping using index finger.  The map displays the maximum of 1000 points. All data appears on the grid as points and/or markers. Places/Address search plot as markers and Datasets plot as points on the grid. The map legend appears on the grid when a search has been executed, displaying the color of the data point and the name of the data being displayed. A retractable information box appears to the bottom right of the grid when a search is performed, displaying the No. of records found or an error message pertaining to a search. The grid has an automatic refresh feature for updating and re-plotting data upon navigating around the map.
</p>

<br>

### Table Grid
<p>
The table grid is located at the bottom of the map. The table becomes active when a search has been performed and returns a set of results on the map. To access the table after a search, click on the black bar at the bottom of the map, there is a white carat displayed in the middle of the black bar below as an indicator that the bar is collapsible. After clicking on the bar, the table will expand upward exposing the table and its components.

<br>

## Saving Searches
<p>
OpenGrid allows a user to create searches; there is also an option to save a search.  To save a query, define a name for your search within the <b>“Save Query As”</b> section of the Find Data Panel.  A successful save will return a message in the lower right corner, “Query was successfully saved".  
</p>

<p>
A search is saved and stored in the <b>Manage Queries</b> panel. Saved searches are also accessible within the <b>LOAD SAVED QUERY</b> drop list located in the <b>Existing Queries</b> section of the Find Data Panel. Load Saved Query section stores the ten most recent saved searches. 
</p>

<p>
A saved search can also be overwritten upon user discretion. To overwrite a search, simply access the save search in the list and within the <b>“Save Query As”</b> textbox remove the saved search name and redefine it. Select the Save button to execute the new save. A warning message within a decision textbox will appear  alarming the user that the name already exist, would you like to continue with the overwrite and as a result it will overwrite the existing query with that name.
