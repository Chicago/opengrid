### Real-time and Historical Spatial Analysis
OpenGrid can be used for real-time data analysis, refreshing frequently to provide the most up-to-date information. It also allows users to reach back into time to look at past events.

### Technical Architecture
OpenGrid is designed to be flexible with different types of data sources. Whether it's MongoDB, a RESTful API, or other data sources, programmers can use [OpenGrid's API](system-administration/opengrid-api#rest-service-resources) and [Service Layer](system-administration/installation-and-setup#service-layer) to program it to work with other data sources.

### Open Source
Open source gives "OpenGrid" its name. Feel free to use it, contribute to it, or change it. Just please take a look at the project's <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/opengrid/blob/master/LICENSE.md">license</a>.
