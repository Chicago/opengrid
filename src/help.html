            <h3 id="quick-search">Quick Search</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>The quick search help feature assist users in performing a valid search. Each search is unique based on query type. Users can query quick search by Address, Lat/Long or Place Name.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Search by Address example:</b><br> 50 W. Washington St</p>

            <p><b>Search by Lat and Long example:</b><br> 41.8270, -87.6423</p>

            <p><b>Search by Place Name example:</b><br> Daley Center<br></p>
            <p>Additionally, data sets that contain zip codes can be searched using the dataset ID (all lowercase) and zip code. The dataset ID is the data set name with “_” instead of spaces.  Below are examples:<br></p>
            <p><b>Business Licenses 60601:</b><br>business_licenses 60601</p>

            <p><b>Pot Holes Reported in 60602:</b><br>311_service_requests_pot_holes_reported 60602<br></p>
            <p>The search results for the above type of search will appear as points on the map. Quick search results will also be displayed in the grid section as rows of data. In general, any type of query whether performed via Quick search or Advanced Search will display on both the map and the grid.</p>

            <h3 id="advanced-search">Advanced Search</h3>
            <p></p><p>Advanced Search allows you to combine search terms by setting specific parameters for your results.It gives the user the ability to narrow their searches by a series of different filters such as adding additional rules, groups,datasets and Geo spatial-filters.</p><p></p>
            <h4 id="selecting-data-and-date-range">Selecting data and date range</h4>
            <p></p><p>To query by data and date range...Click on add datasets, select the saved dataset from the list (for ex: business license); click submit. Add a rule or group to your dataset (Adding a rule or group gives the user an option to query by date, city, name, address, etc. depending on the search criteria.) <br>Date range can be specified with the parameters of:</p><p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>equal</li>
                <li>not equal </li>
                <li>less</li>
                <li>less or equal</li>
                <li>greater </li>
                <li>greater or equal</li>
                <li>between<br></li>
            </ul>
            <p><img alt="Advanced Search" src="images/help/advancedsearch.png"></p>
            <h4>Search around a parameter (Point)</h4>
            <p>To search with given point or boundaries the Geo spatial-filters will have to be applied. There are two filters to search by “Within” and “Near”. “Within” is used to search boundaries within a query. “Near” is used to search within a given parameter or around the area of your local.</p>
            <p><b>Within</b> have search boundaries of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Map Extentu</li>
                <li>Drawn Extent (create polygon or rectangular perimeter)</li>
                <li>Citywide (within the city limits)</li>
                <li>Zip Code (within a given zip code)</li>
                <li>Ward (within a given ward)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Near</b> have search points of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Near</b> “Me” (search around the user geo location)</li>
                <li>Near “<b>Marker</b>” (search around a given area)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Table Functions</h3>
            <p>The table functionality is used to organize information that has been displayed via query. The table displays the data that was pulled from the queried results and in return structures it in a readable format for the user to interpret.</p>
            <p>The table view consists of four drop down sections:</p>
            <p><img alt="Table Funcions" src="images/help/tablefunctions.png"></p>
            <h4 id="1-columns">1. Columns<br></h4>
            <p>The columns section displays the list of columns from the query data-sets and places them in order by default. The columns can be interchangeable and removed to fit the user preference.</p>
            <h4 id="2-exportation">2. Exportation<br></h4>
            <p>The exportation dropdown is used to send or transmit data from the query into csv, pdf or MS- excel format. </p>
            <h4 id="3-graphing">3. Graphing<br></h4>
            <p>The graphing functionality is used to display the query results into graph formation based on the information. The user has the decision to create a graph based key search criteria’s that displays in the dropdown list.</p>
            <h4 id="4-heat-map">4. Heat Map<br></h4>
            <p>Heat Map function is displayed where values contained in a matrix are represented as colors. There are many color schemes that can be used to illustrate a heat map.</p>
            <h3 id="measure-distance-and-area">Measure Distance and Area</h3>
            <p><p>Measuring distances and areas is a function within OpenGrid that allows the user to perform measurements between any given point to another. Once the measurement tool is selected the user will be prompt to start creating measurements by adding points on the map.</p></p>
            <h4 id="measurement-and-tools">Measurement and Tools</h4>
            <p><p>Click the measurement tool icon.</p>
            <img alt="icoa" src="images/help/measurementtool.png" /></p>
            <p>A measurement tool textbox will appear with an option to <b>create a new measurement</b>.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="icob" src="images/help/measuretoolsmenu.png" /></p>
            <p>Once click <b>"create a new measurement"</b>... display points of origin and destination on the map by creating points.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="icoa" src="images/help/measuretools.png" /></p>
            <p>
            <p>After the measurement has been created the finish measurement textbox will appear. click <b>"Finish Measurement"</b>.</p>
            <img alt="icoc" src="images/help/measauredistance.png" /></p>
            <p>After clicking on finish measurement the <b>"Area Measurement"</b> textbox will appear providing information about the perimeter:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Acres</li>
                <li>Feet</li>
                <li>Miles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It also gives the user an option to center on the Area or to Delete the perimeter.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>OpenGrid was developed by the City of Chicago as a way to view information from different city agencies on a single map for situational awareness. First introduced during the NATO conference in 2012, the city expanded OpenGrid to be used internally as a predictive analytics platform.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In January 2016, after Chicago released OpenGrid to the open source community, <a href="http://www.uturndatasolutions.com/">Uturn Data Solutions</a> and the <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a> created a “public” facing version of OpenGrid, for residents, businesses, and communities to better interact with public data from Chicago’s Open Data Portal.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>After launching OpenGrid for the city of Chicago, Uturn Data Solutions and Smart Chicago Collaborative created modified version of OpenGrid that could be easily adopted by other cities and quickly deployed on the Amazon Web Services cloud.</p>
            <p>As a major contributor to the OpenGrid project, Uturn regularly updates its distribution of OpenGrid with the latest features from the open source community. The OpenGrid project is maintained by the City of Chicago on <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/opengrid">Github</a>.</p>
            <p>Additional documentation about the OpenGrid can be found here:</p>
